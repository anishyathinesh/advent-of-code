it is somehow feeling a little repetitive because I think I've used the 
same format of conditionals and accumulators and reaading thru files for 
all of the days.

the discrete math class i took this semester was so so helpful with this
problem! what a nice feeling to apply stuff you learn in math to
programming.

I cranked this one out in half an hour. and now i have to study for my cs
final.
