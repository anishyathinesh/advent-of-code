OMG!!!! I read the problem wrong and thought that the first column was my pick. How embarrassing, I was sitting there for so long to figure out what the problem was. I even posted on the subreddit ðŸ˜­ Good learning experience I guess, reminder to future self to always read the question properly.

Honestly i don't think I solved this problem in the most optimal way but I still like the straightforwardness of my solution. 
  - my first thought when i read rock paper scissors was to convert these values into numbers, because arent these sort of games all just math?! however i couldn't figure out how to implement it so i went with conditionals. maybe a game focused math class down the line will help me out with stuff like this.
